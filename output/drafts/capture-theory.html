<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Push recovery ability has been received much attention in recent years because it is
essential for biped robot to work in non-lab environment. This ability could prevent
biped robot from falling down when facing some perturbations or even big collision.</p>
<p>Even though capture theory based on the 3D-LIPM has a relatively complete and
inspiring result, it is conservative because of strict hypothesis. For example, the collision between swing leg and ground was not considered. in this paper, we primarily interested in the influence of capture point calculating if the
collision is taken into consideration. Three ideal collision models are proposed here to represent the heel-strike
process, which still makes the euqation of capture theory in a analytical format.</p>

<h3>Collision model 1</h3>
<p>The hypotheses of collision model 1 are as follow, and the change of velocities before
and after collision is shown in the plot.</p>
<p>[1] The velocities of CoM before and after collision only exist in the horizontal plane.</p>
<p>[2] The collision is ideal and happens instantaneously.</p>
<p>[3] During collision and after the legs shifting, the length of trailing leg keeps constant.</p>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>Instantaneous capture point results are compared in the following plot. X-axis represents velocity of CoM and Y-axis represents the distance
between instantaneous capture point and the location of CoM. Red line is the result of
3D-LIPM without collision. Green line is the result of 3D-LIPM with collision model
1. Blue line is the result of 3D-LIPM with collision model 2. Pink line is the result of
3D-LIPM with collision model 3. The result of 3D-LIPM without collision is linear,
which means that the instantaneous capture point will go to infinite distance along
with the increase of CoM velocity. However, with the increase of velocity of CoM,
the results of 3D-LIPM with collision models approach to a constant value. This
means that, collision is helpful for human to get into capture state. A preliminary
human push recovery test also indicates that the collision is useful, especially when
under large pushes (high CoM velocity).</p>
