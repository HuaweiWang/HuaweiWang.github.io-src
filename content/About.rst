Current Studying Topic:
"""""""""""""""""""""""
I am trying to understand how humans control their motions by identifying feedback controllers from motion data. The identified controllers are in engineering applicable form, which can be applied on humanoid robotics and prosthetic/orthotic devices. Main approach used in my study is the indirect identification method which turns the controller identification problems into the trajecotry optimization problems. See project lists for more information of how I did it.

Research Interests
""""""""""""""""""
**Wearable Robotics; Human Machine Interaction; Human Motion Analysis and Optimization; Robot Dynamics and Control**
