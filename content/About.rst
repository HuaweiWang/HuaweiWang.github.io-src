I am currently pursuring my PhD degree in the direction of BioMechanics at Cleveland State University. I work in the Human Motion & Control Lab, supervisoring by Dr. van den Bogert. 

Current Study Topic:
""""""""""""""""""""
Identification of engineering applicable feedabck controllers in human motions (for instance, standing balance; perturbed walking). The identification is done through closed-loop identification, which turns the identification problem into trajecotry optimization problem. See Projects for more information.

Research Interests
""""""""""""""""""
Wearable Robotics; Human Machine Interaction; Human Motion Analysis and Optimization; Robot Dynamics and
