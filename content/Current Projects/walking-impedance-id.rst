:summary: Impedance controller identification in human walking unber perturbation


Introduction
""""""""""""



Method
""""""
Impedance control is defined in the following equation, which has virtual spring-damper property when reaching the target position. 

\begin{center}
$T = K_p*(\theta_{tar} - \theta) + K_d*(0 -\dot{\theta})$
\end{center}

where $T$ is the torque generated by the impedance controller; $K_p$, $K_d$, and $\theta_{tar}$ are three impedance control parameters: proportional gains, derivative gains, and target joint position; $\theta$ and $\dot{\theta}$ are the current joint position and joint velocity.\\ 

A pilot study have been done to identify ankle joint impedance parameters from 10 seconds walking data. In the pilot study, two sets impedance parameters were identified from two trials walking data of two subjects. For one data trial, only one set impedance parameters ($K_p, K_d, \theta_{tar}$) is used to control ankle joint among entire gait cycles including both stance and swing phases. The identified impedance parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:impedance_results}. Fits between identified trajectories and experiment data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:impedance_fit}.
