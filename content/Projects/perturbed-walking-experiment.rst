:summary: 21 young adults paricipate in this experiment and their motion, grf and, muscle activation were recorded while walking with AP and ML perturbations.

In this project, 13 Gigabyte perturbed walking data was collected collabrating with Farzad Ehtemam. Twenty-one young adults participated this study. Perturbations
are in both AP and ML directions. Recorded information includes kinematics (motion capture marker data), ground reaction force (2x6 dofs), and muscle activations (11 EMG sensors).

Data cllocation was done in Human Motion & Control Lab at Cleveland State University. Experiment setup is shown in the following picture:
